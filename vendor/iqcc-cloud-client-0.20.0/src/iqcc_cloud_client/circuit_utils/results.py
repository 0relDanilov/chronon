    Works with the result dict returned by ``IQCC_Cloud.execute()``.

    The typical result shape from ``openqasm2qua`` is a flat list of
    single-element lists (one per classical-bit save), interleaved across
    shots::

        "c": [[True], [False], [True], ...]   # length = num_shots * total_clbits

    Args:
        result: Raw result dict from ``execute()``.
        clbit_map: Classical-bit mapping returned by
            :func:`~iqcc_cloud_client.circuit_utils.combine.combine_circuits`.
        num_shots: Expected number of shots.  Used to reshape the flat
            result array.  If *None*, inferred from the data length.

    Returns:
        List of P(|1>) values, one per sub-circuit (same order as *clbit_map*).
